 * @brief   Guidance module for the vehicle
 *
 * Setpoint manager runs at the same rate as the feedback controller
 * and is the interface between the user inputs (input manager) and
 * the feedback controller setpoint. currently it contains very
 * simply logic and runs very quickly which is why it's okay to run
 * in the feedback ISR right before the feedback controller. In the
 * future this is where go-home and other higher level autonomy will
 * live.
 *
 * This serves to allow the feedback controller to be as simple and
 * clean as possible by putting all high-level manipulation of the
 * setpoints here. Then feedback-controller only needs to march the
 * filters and zero them out when arming or enabling controllers
